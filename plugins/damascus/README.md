> Like Damascus steel, documents become stronger through repeated forging.

Damascus is a **Claude Code plugin** that refines documents through an iterative review loop powered by multiple LLMs. Write an implementation plan or technical document, have it reviewed by Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI in parallel, then refine until approved.

```
/forge [-n max] [-o path] <task description>
/forge-team [-n max] [-o path] <task description>
```

## Why

When Claude's plan mode doesn't get it right, you start over. New context, new exploration, new attempt — everything from the previous try is gone. Do this three times and you've spent three full plan mode runs, but the result learned nothing from prior failures.

This is rolling dice until you get a six.

Damascus takes a different approach: **feedback accumulates, context is preserved, and each iteration builds on the last.** The first draft's weaknesses become the second draft's input. Reviewers catch what the author missed, and the author addresses it — within the same context, not from scratch.

The result isn't random. It converges.

### The cost of getting it wrong

Development costs 3–5× more than planning. Without Damascus, you pay that cost every attempt.

```
Without Damascus — re-roll until it works

  Attempt 1:  Plan [====]  →  Develop [================]  →  ✗ flawed
  Attempt 2:  Plan [====]  →  Develop [================]  →  ✗ still flawed
  Attempt 3:  Plan [====]  →  Develop [================]  →  ✓ acceptable

  Total tokens:  ~300K (plan) + ~900K (develop) = ~1.2M
  Prior context:  0% — each attempt starts from scratch
```

```
With Damascus — iterate on the cheap side, develop once

  Iteration 1:  Draft [====]  →  Review [==]  →  refine
  Iteration 2:  Refine [==]   →  Review [==]  →  refine
  Iteration 3:  Refine [==]   →  Review [==]  →  ✓ approved
  Development:  Develop [================]   →  ✓ done

  Total tokens:  ~340K (plan + reviews) + ~300K (develop) = ~640K
  Prior context:  100% — every iteration builds on the last
```

> **~1.2M tokens spent on 3 failed-then-succeeded developments, or ~640K tokens on 3 refined plans and 1 clean development.** The iteration happens where it's cheap.

Fewer tokens isn't just cheaper — it means higher information density in the context window. Re-rolling spends tokens re-exploring the same codebase from scratch. Damascus spends tokens on feedback that refines what's already known.

## How It Works

### `/forge` — Sequential (v3)

```
          ┌─────────────┐
          │   Author    │  Draft the document
          └──────┬──────┘
                 │
          ┌──────▼──────┐
          │    Save     │  Write to file
          └──────┬──────┘
                 │
     ┌───────────┼───────────┐
     ▼           ▼           ▼
  Claude      Gemini      OpenAI     Review in parallel
     └───────────┼───────────┘
                 ▼
          ┌─────────────┐
          │    Judge     │──── Approved ──▶ Done
          └──────┬──────┘
                 │ Needs work
                 └──▶ Back to Author (up to N iterations)
```

Each iteration folds in feedback from all reviewers, strengthening the document like layers of Damascus steel. The authoring agent is **resumed** across iterations — it remembers every file it read, every pattern it discovered, and refines surgically instead of re-exploring from scratch.

### `/forge-team` — Agent Teams (v4)

```
  Lead ──▶ Planner ──▶ Explorers (parallel codebase investigation)
                 ◄──── findings
           Planner ──▶ Lead (plan via ExitPlanMode)
  Lead ──▶ Scribe (polish & write)
  Lead ──▶ Reviewers (parallel: Claude + Gemini + OpenAI)
                 ◄──── reviews
  Lead: verdict ── APPROVED ──▶ Shutdown
                 │ NEEDS_REVISION
                 └──▶ Planner (revise, up to N rounds)
```

Agent Teams mode uses Claude Code's [Agent Teams](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/agent-teams) to run multiple specialized teammates in parallel. Every teammate stays alive across rounds — full context is preserved without resume.

| Role | Count | Responsibility |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Lead** | 1 | Orchestrates rounds, determines verdict |
| **Explorer** | 1–3 | Investigates specific codebase areas, reports to Planner |
| **Planner** | 1 | Manages explorers, synthesizes findings into a plan |
| **Scribe** | 1 | Only agent that writes files (document + review) |
| **Reviewer** | 1–3 | Independent review (Claude, Gemini, OpenAI) |

### v3 vs v4

Both modes produce reviewed, multi-LLM-approved documents. The difference is depth:

| | `/forge` (v3) | `/forge-team` (v4) |
|--|---------------|---------------------|
| **Planning** | Single agent explores & plans | Multiple explorers feed a dedicated planner |
| **Review** | Parallel but independent | Parallel, teammates stay alive |
| **Context** | Agent resume between rounds | Teammates never stop — full context |
| **Best for** | Fast iteration, simple tasks | Deep exploration, complex codebases |

See [docs/v4-comparison/](docs/v4-comparison/) for a side-by-side quality comparison on the same task.

## Design Philosophy

- **Intent over technique** — Trusts Claude's native plan mode rather than overriding it with prompt engineering.
- **Explore first, write second** — Agents deeply investigate the codebase before producing output.
- **Quality over speed** — One well-forged document beats a cycle of implementation mistakes.

## Installation

```bash
# Add marketplace and install
/plugin marketplace add flashwade03/Damascus-For-Claude-Code
/plugin install damascus@planner
```

On the first session, Damascus automatically creates `.claude/damascus.local.md` in your project directory. Fill in your API keys there to enable external reviewers.

## Usage

### Commands

| Command | Mode | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `/forge` | Auto | Decides plan vs. document based on your task |
| `/forge-plan` | Plan | Implementation plans (uses Claude's plan mode) |
| `/forge-doc` | Document | Technical docs — API specs, architecture, design docs |
| `/forge-team` | Auto (Teams) | Agent Teams mode — parallel explorers, dedicated planner |

### Examples

```bash
/forge implement user authentication
/forge write API spec for the payment module

/forge-plan -n 5 implement notification system
/forge-doc -o docs/api/payment.md write API spec for payment
```

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-n <max>` | Max forging iterations | `3` |
| `-o <path>` | Output file path | Auto-detected |

If `-o` is omitted, Damascus detects your project's doc conventions or asks you.

## Configuration

Edit `.claude/damascus.local.md` (auto-created per project):

```yaml
---
gemini_api_key: YOUR_GEMINI_KEY
gemini_model: gemini-3-flash-preview
enable_gemini_review: true

openai_api_key: YOUR_OPENAI_KEY
openai_model: gpt-5.1-codex-mini
enable_openai_review: false

enable_claude_review: true
---
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `gemini_api_key` | Gemini API key | — |
| `gemini_model` | Gemini model | `gemini-3-flash-preview` |
| `enable_gemini_review` | Enable Gemini reviewer | `false` |
| `openai_api_key` | OpenAI API key | — |
| `openai_model` | OpenAI model | `gpt-5.1-codex-mini` |
| `enable_openai_review` | Enable OpenAI reviewer | `false` |
| `enable_claude_review` | Enable Claude reviewer | `true` |

## Agents

### Sequential mode (`/forge`)

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Planner** | Opus (plan mode) | Explores codebase, creates implementation plans |
| **Author** | Opus | Explores codebase, writes technical documents |
| **Claude Reviewer** | Sonnet | Cross-references document against actual codebase |

### Agent Teams mode (`/forge-team`)

| Agent | Model | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Lead** | Opus | Orchestrates rounds, collects reviews, determines verdict |
| **Explorer** | Sonnet | Investigates assigned codebase areas, reports to Planner |
| **Planner** | Sonnet/Opus (plan mode) | Manages explorers, synthesizes plan, calls ExitPlanMode |
| **Scribe** | Sonnet | Polishes plans, writes documents and review files |
| **Claude Reviewer** | Sonnet | Cross-references document against actual codebase |
| **Gemini Reviewer** | Haiku | Runs Gemini review script, relays results |
| **OpenAI Reviewer** | Haiku | Runs OpenAI review script, relays results |

### Review Criteria

All reviewers evaluate against five dimensions:

1. **Codebase Grounding** — References real files, functions, and patterns
2. **Clarity** — Coherent reasoning, well-justified approach
3. **Completeness** — No obvious gaps or missing edge cases
4. **Feasibility** — Technically sound and implementable
5. **Testability** — Clear path to verification
