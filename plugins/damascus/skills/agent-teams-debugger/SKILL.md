# agent-teams-debugger

Diagnose and resolve issues in Damascus `/forge-team` Agent Teams sessions. This skill encodes hard-won debugging knowledge from real production failures.

## Quick Triage

When the user reports a stuck session, identify which phase is stuck:

| Symptom | Likely Phase | Jump To |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| "Nothing happening after start" | Phase 0 or 1 | [Setup Phase Failures](#setup-phase-failures) first, then [Planner Issues](#planner-issues) |
| "Explorers finished but plan not submitted" | Phase 1 — ExitPlanMode | [ExitPlanMode Failures](#exitplanmode-failures) |
| "Plan submitted but file not written" | Phase 2 — Writing | [Scribe Issues](#scribe-issues) |
| "File written but reviews not arriving" | Phase 3 — Review | [Message Routing](#message-routing) |
| "Reviews done but no verdict / no next round" | Phase 4 — Consolidation | [Message Routing](#message-routing) |
| "Session just hangs indefinitely" | Any | [Full Diagnostic](#full-diagnostic-procedure) |

## Full Diagnostic Procedure

Run these steps in order. At each step, also **rule out other known failures** — explicitly note which patterns you checked and eliminated. This differential diagnosis prevents misattribution when symptoms overlap (e.g., "nothing happening" could be Setup Phase failure OR ExitPlanMode failure).

### Step 1: Check Team Exists

```bash
ls ~/.claude/teams/damascus-forge/
```

Expected: `config.json` + `inboxes/` directory. If missing → team was never created or was already deleted.

### Step 2: Check Inbox State

```bash
# List all inboxes
ls ~/.claude/teams/damascus-forge/inboxes/

# Check Lead's inbox for unread messages
cat ~/.claude/teams/damascus-forge/inboxes/team-lead.json | jq '.[] | select(.read == false)'

# Check specific teammate inbox
cat ~/.claude/teams/damascus-forge/inboxes/planner.json | jq '.[] | select(.read == false)'
```

Key insight: **Lead's inbox is `team-lead.json`**, NOT `lead.json`. This is the #1 routing bug — see [Message Routing](#message-routing).

**Differential checks at this step:**
- If `lead.json` exists → routing bug (F-001), jump to [Message Routing](#message-routing)
- If only `team-lead.json` + `planner.json` exist (no explorer/scribe/reviewer inboxes) → [Setup Phase Failures](#setup-phase-failures)
- If explorer inboxes exist but `team-lead.json` has no `plan_approval_request` → [ExitPlanMode Failures](#exitplanmode-failures)

### Step 3: Trace Message Flow

```bash
# See all messages in order
for f in ~/.claude/teams/damascus-forge/inboxes/*.json; do
  echo "=== $(basename $f) ==="
  cat "$f" | jq -r '.[] | "\(.read)\t\(.type)\t\(.sender // "system")\t\(.content[:80])"'
done
```

Look for:
- Messages with `read: false` — these are undelivered/unread
- Messages in `lead.json` (wrong) instead of `team-lead.json` (correct)
- Missing expected messages (e.g., explorer findings never sent to planner)

## Known Failure Patterns

### Setup Phase Failures

**Lead skips spawning teammates (F-008)** — Explorers, scribe, or reviewers never created

The Lead must spawn all teammates during the Setup Phase before entering the Round Flow. If it jumps directly to sending PLANNING PHASE to the planner without spawning explorers, the planner has no one to assign work to and stalls.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check which inboxes exist — missing inboxes = missing teammates
ls ~/.claude/teams/damascus-forge/inboxes/

# Expected for a healthy session: team-lead.json, planner.json, explorer-1.json,
# explorer-2.json (or more), scribe.json, reviewer-claude.json, etc.
# If only team-lead.json + planner.json exist → Setup Phase was skipped
```

**Malformed task message** — even if teammates are spawned, the PLANNING PHASE message to the planner must include the explorer list, mode, and ExitPlanMode reinforcement. Compare the actual message against the format in `skills/forge-team-orchestrator/references/round-flow.md`.

**Fix:** Delete team and restart. Verify the Lead follows forge-team-orchestrator's Setup Phase (spawn all teammates) before entering Round 1.

### Message Routing

**The `'lead'` vs `'team-lead'` Bug** — CRITICAL, confirmed in 9+ sessions

The Lead teammate is spawned with `name: "team-lead"`. Its inbox file is `team-lead.json`. However, it's natural to use `recipient: "lead"` in SendMessage — this creates a **separate `lead.json`** file that Lead never reads.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# If this file exists, you have the routing bug
ls ~/.claude/teams/damascus-forge/inboxes/lead.json

# Check for unread messages in wrong inbox
cat ~/.claude/teams/damascus-forge/inboxes/lead.json | jq 'length'
```

**Fix:** All teammate prompts must use `recipient: "team-lead"` (not `"lead"`). Check `skills/forge-team-orchestrator/references/teammate-prompts.md` — every SendMessage example must specify `recipient: "team-lead"`.

### ExitPlanMode Failures

**ExitPlanMode not mentioned in prompt → plan mode never works**

100% correlation across 9 sessions: if the planner's spawn prompt does not explicitly mention `ExitPlanMode`, the planner never submits a plan. The `mode: "plan"` on the Agent tool sets `planModeRequired: true`, but the planner needs to know it must call ExitPlanMode.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if planner has been in plan mode
cat ~/.claude/teams/damascus-forge/inboxes/team-lead.json | jq '.[] | select(.type == "plan_approval_request")'
```

If no `plan_approval_request` exists → planner never called ExitPlanMode.

**Fix:** Ensure the planner prompt contains:
1. "You operate in plan mode"
2. "Call ExitPlanMode to submit your plan to Lead"
3. Both phrases — one alone is insufficient

### Planner Issues

**Planner waiting for explorers that finished**

The planner prompt says "wait until all have reported." If an explorer sends findings but the planner doesn't receive them, it waits indefinitely.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check explorer messages to planner
cat ~/.claude/teams/damascus-forge/inboxes/planner.json | jq '.[] | select(.sender | startswith("explorer"))'
```

**Planner stuck in revision loop (Round 2+)**

On Round 2+, the planner must call `EnterPlanMode` before `ExitPlanMode`. If it doesn't, it can't submit the revised plan.

**Diagnosis:** Check if planner received the revision message from team-lead and whether a `plan_approval_request` was generated.

### Scribe Issues

**Scribe not writing**

The scribe is the ONLY agent with write access (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`). If it's stuck, the file won't be written.

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if scribe received instructions
cat ~/.claude/teams/damascus-forge/inboxes/scribe.json | jq '.[] | select(.read == false)'

# Check if scribe confirmed write
cat ~/.claude/teams/damascus-forge/inboxes/team-lead.json | jq '.[] | select(.sender == "scribe")'
```

### N-Planner Sync (Architecture Warning)

**Never use multiple planners.** When a planner sends a DONE message and then receives any new message, it reactivates and may send conflicting plans. This was solved by using a single Planner + N Explorers architecture. If you see multiple `planner-N` teammates, the architecture is wrong.

## Recovery Actions

| Problem | Recovery |
|---------|----------|
| Wrong inbox routing | Fix prompts, restart session |
| ExitPlanMode not called | Cannot fix mid-session — restart with corrected prompt |
| Setup Phase skipped | `TeamDelete("damascus-forge")`, restart — verify Lead spawns all teammates before Round 1 |
| Malformed task message | Restart — check message format against round-flow.md |
| Single teammate stuck | Send a nudge message via SendMessage |
| Team state corrupted | `TeamDelete("damascus-forge")`, restart session |
| Max rounds reached but not approved | Normal behavior — report final verdict to user |
